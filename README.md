# Project Description

Our project's goal is to recreate the game "Tomb of the Mask." It combines a maze with obstacles such as spikes, darts, and rising lava. Players travel in short bursts in one direction from wall to wall to navigate the maze, collect points, and avoid death. This game also includes a build mode, where an user can build their own maze to play.

# Intended usage:

Users will begin in play mode and can use the spacebar to switch between build and play mode. In play mode, the user controls a character moving through a maze using the arrow keys. The objective is to collect points, make it to the end, and avoid any obstacle that could kill you. 

In build mode, users can build a maze tile by tile on a grid. Users click the mouse to place things, use the t key to switch between tiles, spikes, dart traps, and points, and can use the r key the rotate them.

The game interface includes:
- A grid layout
- On screen text that displays selected item, rotation, current mode, and score(play mode)

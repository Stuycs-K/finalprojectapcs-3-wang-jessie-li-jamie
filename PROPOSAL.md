# IDEAS:

1 Platformer: 2D top-down platformer where you play as a character and navigate through different puzzle-like platforms where you can move platforms to get to the destination or shift between two dimensions (somewhat like https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1223047).

2 Fish Eat Fish: You play as a fish who can eat other fish. You can eat fish that’s smaller than you but you’ll get eaten by fish that’s bigger than you (game over). Everytime you eat a fish, you get bigger. (Reference: https://www.twoplayergames.org/game/fish-eat-fish)

3 Turn-based Strategy Game: A turn-based game with a linear progression through a simple path/grid map. There's going to be a boss fight in the end, but along the way there's going to be enemy encounters and if you kill the enemies, you get consumables (health positions, buffs, better weapons?, etc.). For each enemy encounter, you can have the option of skipping it but you would skip out on the opportunity for the consumables and you can't go back to the enemy encounters. The game ends when you die. (Reference article: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnBasedStrategy somewhat like this but simpler and linear)

# Technical Details:

Project Description: Our project will be a copy of the game, Tomb of the Mask. You play as a character navigating through a maze to reach the end. Throughout the maze, there are hazards along the way, as well as assets that will assist you along the way. You collect points as you proceed, but there is lava that will continuously rise as time goes by that will instantly kill you when you come into contact with it. The hazards that you will encounter are spikes (moving and static), dart traps, bats. puffer fishes, and snakes.         

Critical Features: Spikes (static), lava, dart traps, maze, character, points

Nice to have features: Bat, puffer fishes, snakes, ice box, breakable walls
